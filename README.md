## Main idea
The core idea is to have a website built in **React + Redux** that displays
a user's portfolio to them (with up to 12 different stock charts), and others who may find it interesting. 
A user can also visit other people's **customized** portfolio.
A user shall be able to customize their profile by means of resizing elements/
and or by selecting different possible **layouts** (see figure 1). Furthermore, a user shall be able to customize
the background image of their profile.

*below should be moved to Functional/Technological*
A user shall be able to pick their stock charts from the *Yahoo Finance API*
All charts and customizations will be saved in a database using *Flask-Sql-lite a backend*.
